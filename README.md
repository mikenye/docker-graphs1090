# mikenye/graphs1090

[`graphs1090`](https://github.com/wiedehopf/graphs1090) is an excellent tool by [wiedehopf](https://github.com/wiedehopf) that generates graphs for `dump1090`/`readsb` and their variants.

This container receives:
* Beast data from a provider such as `dump1090` or `readsb`
* Optionally, MLAT data from a provider such as `mlat-client` (if you want to see MLAT statistics)

It builds and runs on `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v7` and `linux/arm64` (see below).

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` should always contain the latest released version of `graphs1090`. This image is built nightly from the `master` branch `Dockerfile` for all supported architectures.
* `development` (`dev` branch, `Dockerfile`, `amd64` architecture only, built on commit, not recommended for production)
* Specific version tags are available if required, however these are not regularly updated. It is generally recommended to run latest.

## Multi Architecture Support

* `linux/amd64` (`x86_64`): Built on Linux x86-64
* `linux/arm/v7` (`armv7l`, `armhf`, `arm32v7`): Built on Odroid HC2 running ARMv7 32-bit
* `linux/arm64` (`aarch64`, `arm64v8`): Built on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B running ARMv8 64-bit

## Prerequisites

You will need a source of Beast data. This could be an RPi running PiAware, the [`mikenye/piaware`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/piaware) image or [`mikenye/readsb`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/readsb).

Optionally, you will need a source of MLAT data. This could be an RPi running PiAware, the [`mikenye/piaware`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikenye/piaware) image, or any other host/container running `mlat-client` that is configured to *listen* for Beast connections.

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=graphs1090 \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -e TZ=<TIMEZONE> \
    -e BEASTHOST=<BEASTHOST> \
    -e MLATHOST=<MLATHOST> \
    -e LAT=<ANTENNA_LATITUDE> \
    -e LONG=<ANTENNA_LONGITUDE> \
    mikenye/graphs1090:latest
```

Replacing:
* `TIMEZONE` with your timezone
* `BEASTHOST` with the IP address/hostname of a host that can provide Beast data
* `MLATHOST` with the IP address/hostname of a host that can provide MLAT data
* `LAT` with your antenna's latitude (optional, but required for range graph)
* `LONG` with your antenna's longitude (optional, but required for range graph)

For example:

```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=graphs1090 \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -v graphs1090_rrd:/var/lib/collectd/rrd \
    -e TZ=Australia/Perth \
    -e BEASTHOST=readsb \
    -e MLATHOST=piaware \
    -e LAT=-33.33333 \
    -e LONG=111.11111 \
    mikenye/graphs1090:latest
```

You should now be able to browse to http://dockerhost:8080 to access the `graphs1090` web interface.

## Up-and-Running with `docker-compose`

An example `docker-compose.xml` file is below:

```yaml
version: '2.0'

volumes:
  graphs1090_rrd:

services:
  graphs1090:
    image: mikenye/graphs1090:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: graphs1090
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - graphs1090_rrd:/var/lib/collectd/rrd
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    environment:
      - BEASTHOST=readsb
      - MLATHOST=piaware
      - TZ=Australia/Perth
      - LAT=-33.33333
      - LONG=111.11111
```

You should now be able to browse to http://dockerhost:8080 to access the `graphs1090` web interface.

## Ports

### Outgoing

This container will try to connect to:
* `BEASTHOST` on TCP port `30005` by default. This can be changed by setting the `BEASTPORT` environment variable.
* If specified, `MLATHOST` on TCP port `30105` by default. This can be changed by setting the `MLATPORT` environment variable.

### Incoming

This container accepts HTTP connections on TCP port `80` by default. You can change this with the container's port mapping. In the examples above, this has been changed to `8080`.

## Runtime Environment Variables

| Environment Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| BEASTHOST | Required. IP/Hostname of a Mode-S/Beast provider (`dump1090`/`readsb`) | |
| BEASTPORT | Optional. TCP port number of Mode-S/Beast provider (`dump1090`/`readsb`) | `30005` |
| MLATHOST | Optional. IP/Hostname of an MLAT provider | |
| MLATPORT | Optional. TCP port number of MLAT provider | `30105` |
| LAT | Optional. Latitude of your antenna | |
| LONG | Optional. Longitude of your antenna | |
| TZ | Optional but recommended. Your local timezone in [TZ-database-name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) format | |

Without setting the `TZ` environment variable, the graphs generated by `graphs1090` won't be in your local timezone, and will instead be in `UTC`.

Without setting the `MLATHOST` environment variables, the graphs generated by `graphs1090` won't have any MLAT data.

Without setting the `LAT` and `LONG` environment variables, the graphs generated by `graphs1090` won't include range data.

## Logging

All logs are to the container's stdout and can be viewed with `docker logs [-f] container`.
